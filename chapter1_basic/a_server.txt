1. Express and it's use
>> Express is the framework used for handling route parts
>> Before expressJs we were using plain NodeJs with http module usage that is with more boiler plate
but the Express Js is more flexible and easy to set-up things

2. ExpressJs (handle the ROUTE with options)
>> "^/$|index.html"  --- This means it can be "/" or "/index.html"
>> What if user types like "https://www.example.com/index" alone? -- to handle this we can use something 
like "^/$|index(.html)?"

3. Redirect to different page?
>> This can be done with [response.redirect] but we need to use the status code along with it, just like
response.redirect(301, 'fileName.html');

4. Error Page - It should always be sent with status code, check below example
To handle error page, always use RESPONSE.STATUS(404)
>> response.status(404).sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'views', 'error-page.html'));

5, next() -> This is to handle next function, it's a middleware
