Routing

1. Routing and it's use?
>> Routing is used to handle the sub directory of our app files. (i.e., In VIEWS we might have some files and also some 
other dirs, to handle the files in dirs we will be using this ROUTES concept)
>> Basically, we will handle the sub dir files as our mini apps

2. Apply styles to sub directories as well?
// Built-in Middleware - to serve the necessary CSS, images and other required files at prior stage
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, './public'))); //by default it applies to ROOT directory, to point to different dir (i.e., subdir -> mention path like below line)
app.use('./subdir', express.static(path.join(__dirname, './public')));
